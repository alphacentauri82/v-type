# v-type

## Abstract:
[Take this personality quiz](https://tessasac.github.io/v-type/) to find out what kind of Vue Vixen you are!

Originally created as an ice-breaker social activity for the [VueNYC x Vue Vixens workshop](https://www.meetup.com/vueJsNYC/events/251602765/).

## Project setup
`yarn`

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
`yarn serve`

### Compiles and minifies for production
`yarn build`

### Lints and fixes files
`yarn lint`


## Suggested use:
1. Have a gathering of workshop attendees take the quiz and group with their fellow v-types.

2. Walk through the 'from real life' situational prompts non-men face frequently at work (see prompts.md), especially in the tech industry, and discuss amongst themselves:
  - how they would address the situation
  - whether they've experienced the situation
  - what it makes them feel
  - etc.

3. After each ask the group as a whole if any of them would like to share with the larger group any insights, etc.

4. At the end ask the audience to close their eyes and raise their hands if they've experienced (alt: and/or witnessed) any of the situations described.

5. Invite them to keep their hands up if they feel safe then to open their eyes and look around.

6. End with an air-clearing exercise, e.g.:
  - Have everyone stand up, hunch their shoulders and scrunch down their necks really tight
  - Suddenly let them drop with a sigh to temporarily disengage any tightness in the shoulder girdle
  - Have them close their eyes and breathe in and out three times to a Vue meditation, e.g.
    - events up
    - props down
