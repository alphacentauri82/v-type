# Discussion Prompts:

## Note: Prompts should draw from irl experiences

### Situation:
You are speaking during a one-on-one meeting and your coworker interrupts you. When you tell them you weren’t done yet, they respond, “Just let me finish this first.”

### Situation:
You find you often have to repeat yourself several times to be heard by your coworkers, as well as to justify any work requests with numerous reasons where your male coworkers do not.

### Situation:
You’re supposed to be running a meeting, but attendees keep talking over you and behaving disrespectfully. When you finally demand order you are told to “calm down” and are admonished for being “confrontational” in front of the rest of the team.

### Situation:
You ask your coworker to help you through a merge conflict and instead they explain to you how to use Git. They ignore you telling them multiple times you already know how to use Git.

### Situation:
You're working on an app and notice a potentially brittle choice Coworker A has made in an area you are more familiar with. At the next architecture meeting, you explain the potential issue. You then suggest a slight amendment, to which Coworker A snaps that they don't want to make huge changes and implies you don't know what you're doing. A male coworker B suggests, as a compromise, the slight amendment you'd just put forth. Coworker A assents and the team applauds Coworker B's idea -- not to mention his reasonable and cooperative approach.
